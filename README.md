## File Organizer

The File Organizer is a Python script designed to streamline the organization of files within a specified directory based on their file extensions. With this script, you can effortlessly categorize and tidy up your files, making it easier to locate and manage them.

### Features:
- Automatically organizes files into separate directories based on their file extensions (e.g., PDFs, videos, images, executables).
- Supports common file types such as PDF, MKV, PNG, and more.
- Simple and easy-to-use script that can be run directly from the command line.
- Utilizes the `os` and `shutil` Python libraries for efficient file handling and directory manipulation.
- Flexible and customizable: Easily modify the script to add support for additional file types or customize destination directories.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository or download the script (`file_organizer.py`) to your local machine.
2. Open the script in a Python IDE or text editor and configure the `directory_path` variable to specify the directory containing the files you want to organize.
3. Run the script (`python file_organizer.py`) from the command line.
4. Sit back and watch as the script organizes your files into designated directories based on their file extensions.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x 
- `os` and `shutil` standard libraries (no additional dependencies)

### Example:
```bash
python file_organizer.py
```
